## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-wallet-hunter.git
cd bitcoin-wallet-hunter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt you for:
1. Number of threads to use (suggests optimal value)
2. Number of wallets to generate
3. Whether to log generated wallets (optional)

### Runtime Information

The program displays real-time information:
- Current progress and speed
- Batch size adjustments
- Memory usage statistics
- Found matches (if any)

### Output Files

- `found.txt`: Contains matched wallet addresses and private keys
- `wallets.log`: Optional log of all generated wallets
- `btcfinder.log`: Program execution logs and errors

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Optimal Thread Count**
   - Use suggested thread count (CPU cores - 1)
   - Leave one core for system operations

2. **Wallet Logging**
   - Enable only when necessary
   - Affects disk I/O and overall performance
   - Uses buffered writing for efficiency

3. **Batch Size**
   - Automatically optimizes based on system performance
   - Adjusts dynamically during runtime
   - Can be monitored in real-time

## üõ° Security Notes

- Private keys are handled securely
- Optional logging with user confirmation
- Safe shutdown mechanisms
- No external API dependencies
