### Performance Metrics

| Operation          | Speed (ops/sec) | Memory Usage |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Wallet Generation | ~50,000         | ~100MB      |
| Address Matching  | ~100,000        | ~50MB       |
| File I/O         | ~10,000         | Varies      |

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Logging System

- Rotated log files with UTC timestamps
- Structured logging format
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error tracing and debugging information

### Resource Usage

The application automatically monitors and adjusts based on:
- CPU utilization
- Memory consumption
- Disk I/O operations
- Network bandwidth (if applicable)

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- Private key handling with secure memory wiping
- Cryptographic operations using standard libraries
- No external API dependencies for core operations
- Secure random number generation

## ⚡ Optimization Tips

1. **Process Pool Configuration**
```python
process_count = min(cpu_count() - 1, 4)  # Reserve one core for system
```

2. **Memory-Mapped Files**
```python
with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
    mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)
```

3. **JIT Compilation**
```python
@numba.jit(nopython=True)
def performance_critical_function():
    # Your code here
```
